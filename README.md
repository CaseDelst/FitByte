<h1>FitByte</h1>

This is a project I started as I've been getting more and more interested in data manipulation and study after getting a FitBit Charge 3.  Right now it is a very rudimentary data collector using the FitBit web API :

My goal is to store as much data as physically possible, and after gathering enough, hopefully create some interesting analysis on my life!
